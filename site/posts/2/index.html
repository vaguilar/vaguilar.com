<h2 class="title">DIY Arduino Board Compatible with 5v and 3.3v</h2>

<p class="date">Posted on <em>5/2/2016</em></p>

<p>
  A long time ago I created a breakout board for an ATmega328p to prototype some
  projects, but time has not been too kind with it. It was hastily made on a
  single sided homemade PCB, has lots of jumper wires and some of the pins no
  longer work, probably because my soldering job wasn't too great. After getting
  tired of these issues and having to put up with different voltages for
  different components, I decided to create a better board that can work with
  both 3.3v and 5v.

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
  The ATmega328p chip is only rated up to 8MHz for 3.3v, so makes sense to run
  it at 5v and convert the output down to 3.3v to run it at 16MHz. The idea then
  is to find a chip that you can easily connect outpins to and then have the
  signals converted to 3.3v.

<p>
  I'm not too fond of SMT parts since they require patience and time to put
  together, of which I have neither at the moment. So I looked around and found
  this
  <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/sn74lvc245a.pdf">74LVC245 IC</a>
  that is fast enough to convert voltages to use UART and SPI. 5v signals go in
  one end and 3.3v come out the other side. Perfect. Conversion from 3.3v to 5v
  isn't necessary since the ATmega will read them just fine. Probably. And off
  to Eagle CAD we go.

  I use a <a href="http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/">USBasp Programmer</a> that I
  bought off eBay to program my AVR chips (JP1). If you want to do that as well,
  be sure to buy one thats programmed already, if not you'll end up with a
  chicken and egg problem where you need a programmer to program the firmware to
  your programmer (learned the hard way). The USBasp provides 5v from the USB
  port and then a
  <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LD1117V33.pdf"
    >LD1117v33</a
  >
  (U$1) is used to provide the 3.3v we need for the 74LVC245 chip. Note that the
  pins are wired incorrectly for the LD1117V33 in the schematic because I used
  the footprint for another similiar chip that I was too lazy to edit. When
  designing the schematic, the typical applications section from the data sheets
  of each chip are quite helpful. They sometimes have an example of exactly what
  you are trying to do

  And then came the somewhat tedious and boring part; lots of trial and error
  for placing the components and routing the board efficiently. I tried my best
  to keep the size of the PCB small to decrease cost, but it ended up being only
  slightly smaller than an Arduino due to not using SMT components. I also added
  labels for both Arduino pin numbers and the traditional ATmega pin names, as
  sometimes I need both. Parts and boards were ordered off Digi-key and OSH Park
  respectively.

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>
  Took a whole afternoon to solder everything together but it turned out great.
  The onboard 5v to 3.3v conversion works fantastic, beats having to constantly
  switch the power supply to the ATmega. It is a perfect replacement for the old
  board. Now I just need projects ideas to use it...
